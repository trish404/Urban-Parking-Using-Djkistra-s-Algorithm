# 🚗 Parking Spot Allocation System using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## Overview

A Smart Parking Management System to tackle illegal parking and improve space efficiency using a grid-based layout and Dijkstra's algorithm for optimal spot allocation.

## 🔑 Features

- 🅿️ Closest spot allocation using Dijkstra's algorithm
- 🚫 Illegal parking prevention through strict spot assignment
- 📍 Differentiated zones for short- and long-term parking
- ⏱ Real-time tracking and automated fee calculation
- 📲 Visual directions and notifications for users
- 🔁 Extend parking duration easily
- 🧾 One-click deallocation with billing

## 🚀 How It Works

- The lot is a grid; Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the shortest path to available spots.
- Users are assigned spots based on vehicle type and preference.
- Real-time visual layout with occupancy updates.
- Illegal parking is flagged and prevented by the system.
- Stay time is tracked; users are billed accordingly and can extend time if needed.
- Upon exit, spots are deallocated and timers reset.

## 🛠 Technical Highlights

- Grid-based node system with distance-based connections
- Real-time monitoring dashboard for admin oversight

## 🔮 Future Plans

- IoT sensor integration  
- Mobile app for remote control  
- Multi-lot support  
- Dynamic pricing models
